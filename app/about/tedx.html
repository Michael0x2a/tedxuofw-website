			<h3>About TEDx</h3>
			          
		      <p><strong>x = independently organized event</strong></p>
		      
		      <p>
		        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, 
		        <a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program">TEDx</a>
		        is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to 
		        share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers 
		        combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, 
		        self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED 
		        event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but 
		        individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and 
		        regulations.)
