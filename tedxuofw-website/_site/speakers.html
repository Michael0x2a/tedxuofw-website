We independently plan and host a TEDx event every spring here at UW. What is TEDx? In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxUofW, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxUofW event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized."/><meta name="keywords" content="TEDxUofW, TEDx, TED, University of Washington, UW, TEDxUW, talks, TED talks, RSO"/><link rel="image_src" href="/assets/images/ted-logo-lightbulb-white-fb.png"/><link href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.0.3/css/font-awesome.css" rel="stylesheet"/><link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/styles-cd5a56cecc9dee399d5f42832d6874ac.css"><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico"/> <!--[if lt IE 9]><script src="https://oss.maxcdn.com/libs/html5shiv/3.7.0/html5shiv.js"></script><script src="https://oss.maxcdn.com/libs/respond.js/1.4.2/respond.min.js"></script><![endif]--><link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/jquery.fancybox-a582d4e35ff148aeeee71e8e4d759f8e.css"></head><body role="document" class="hyphenate"> <!--[if lte IE 8]><div class="container old-ie"><h1>Uh oh!</h1><p>It looks like you're using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.

Mired in poverty and violence as a child, homeless in the womb with no cultural roots – he has come a long way and founded a life-coaching and educational consulting organization, <a href="http://experienceease.com/">Experience Ease</a>. Education transformed his life and his life’s work. During his 6 years at the UW, he continued to notice a jarring reality – people who devoted their lives to dismantling or reforming systems (racism, capitalism, imperialism, sexism, etc.) were the very ones perpetuating and reproducing them by always moving relative to them. After unsuccessful attempts at broader social change, he focused on self-development and has completely transformed his life through good thoughts, practices and ways of living based in ancient traditions such as meditation, yoga, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Shaolin Kung Fu and Capoeira Angola Palmares. Experience Ease helps students and families use the school experience to develop more fundamental life skills. Their motto: “we live the life we teach” – so you know it’s real.</p></div></div></div><div class="speaker" id="speaker-julia_robinson"><h2>Julia Robinson</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-4 col-md-3 unit"> <img class="full" src="/assets/2014/speakers/julia-robinson-e178c10502b603cad050b62fc47a72ce.jpg" alt="Julia Robinson"/></div><div class="col-sm-8 col-md-9 unit bio"><h3>Transcending Technology in Global Health</h3><div class="video"> <a class="btn btn-default fancybox fancybox.iframe youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0ZAPUPEC510?autoplay=1"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></span> Watch now</a></div><p>Julia Robinson is the Deputy Director of Côte d’Ivoire Programs and Director of Advocacy Programs at <a href="http://www.healthallianceinternational.org">Health Alliance International</a>, a center of the University of Washington’s Department of Global Health.

Her amazing feat was opening Washington State’s first Adventure Playground and only the fourth Adventure Playground in the United States. In fact, her work and the Adventure Playground garnered national attention, leading to a fantastic award: <a href="http://kaboom.org/take_action/playmaker_network/playmaker_month/mercer_island_parks_and_recreation">KaBOOM’s Playmaker of the Month</a> (check out <a href="http://kaboom.org/">KaBOOM</a> for more information). In the fall of 2009, while employed with the City of Mercer Island Parks and Recreation Department, Ann set out to open the best playground on Mercer Island. Countless hours of research leading up to the implementation and opening of the playground painted a very scary reality of modern play - it is declining and the long term effects are huge. Ann’s TEDx talk will explore the wonders of Adventure Playgrounds and the important role they have on inspiring future innovators who could create anything from inventions that curb climate change to the stories we love to get lost in. Ann promises to make you: laugh, pause to think about the role we all have in an innovative future, and instill that our imagination gives us wings even beyond childhood.</p></div></div></div><div class="speaker" id="speaker-troy_osaki"><h2>Troy Osaki</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-4 col-md-3 unit"> <img class="full" src="/assets/2014/speakers/troy-osaki-d69713430746070df01aca0ef2896164.jpg" alt="Troy Osaki"/></div><div class="col-sm-8 col-md-9 unit bio"><h3>Transformative Storytelling: Poetry as a Tool for Liberation</h3><div class="video"> <a class="btn btn-default fancybox fancybox.iframe youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/p3KcFOZ3T4c?autoplay=1"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></span> Watch now</a></div><p>Troy Osaki is a writer, performer and spoken word artist from Seattle, WA.

Until approximately 2008, his research was primarily in computer science and robotics. At about that time, he learned the basics of genetic engineering completely switched fields to synthetic biology and now runs an interdisciplinary group of engineers, biologists, experimentalists, and theorists – all focused on engineering life. In particular, Eric’s research concerns developing programming languages and abstractions that can be used to design, fabricate, test, and refine new organisms. Example applications include synthetic multicellular consortia that digest plant matter and produce biofuels, diagnose disease, or assemble into complex patterns and shapes. Eric is one of a new generation of new synthetic biologists eager to scale up the production of designer living organisms and put them to good use addressing pressing problems of the 21st century.</p></div></div></div><div class="speaker" id="speaker-sarah_olson"><h2>Sarah Olson</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-4 col-md-3 unit"> <img class="full" src="/assets/2014/speakers/sarah-olson-385e96334d0df083efc344fd75640378.jpg" alt="Sarah Olson"/></div><div class="col-sm-8 col-md-9 unit bio"><h3>Sharing a Vision: Scientists and Animal Rights Activists Working Together</h3><div class="video"> <a class="btn btn-default fancybox fancybox.iframe youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wzvlw9O3IbQ?autoplay=1"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></span> Watch now</a></div><p>Sarah Olson is a sophomore at the University of Washington and a Comparative History of Ideas major with a tri-focus in critical human-animal, gender and environmental studies. A lifelong interest in animal ethics has led her to explore the systems of oppression through which humans and animals interact. Sarah is especially passionate about and interested in biotechnology strategies that are superior to animal testing in predicting efficacy or toxicity of drugs or cosmetics. She believes it is crucial to develop and fund effective and affordable alternatives to animal testing in order for system-wide progress to be made. Rather than pointing blame or working against one another, researchers and animal rights activists can work together to make alternatives to animal research possible, creating a win-win solution in which more effective models can be used and fewer animals harmed.</p></div></div></div><div class="speaker" id="speaker-dean_chahim"><h2>Dean Chahim</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-4 col-md-3 unit"> <img class="full" src="/assets/2014/speakers/dean-chahim-45ef536d56577d641c2c245de46e5c7a.jpg" alt="Dean Chahim"/></div><div class="col-sm-8 col-md-9 unit bio"><h3>The False Hope of Technology</h3><div class="video"> <a class="btn btn-default fancybox fancybox.iframe youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/53iihyJ3wK0?autoplay=1"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></span> Watch now</a></div><p>Dean Chahim is an environmental engineer, educator, and community organizer from Seattle. Growing out of a disenchantment with the way engineering is taught and practiced, he recently jointly designed and taught (with Daniel Ullom) a popular seminar for engineering students at the UW on “<a href="http://e4sj.wordpress.com/">Engineering for Social Justice</a>”. He has also taught an innovative <a href="http://cdfseminar.tumblr.com/">course</a> and published articles in <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/aseem/nicaragua.pdf">academic</a> and <a href="http://deanchahim.com/op-eds/">popular</a> media on international development and global justice issues.</p><p>As an engineer focusing on cleaning up after toxic spills, he has donned rubber boots to collect samples and help assess contaminated sites across the Puget Sound, from the Duwamish shoreline to Gas Works Park. He is also one of the volunteer organizers of the <a href="http://seasol.net/">Seattle Solidarity Network</a>, a grassroots worker-tenant organizing project that builds community power through struggles against unjust housing and working conditions.</p><p>Dean graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S.C.E. in Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering and a B.A. with Honors in International Development. Following graduation, he traveled across ten countries in the global South with the support of a Bonderman Fellowship, learning with everyday people and activists struggling for social change. This fall, he will begin doctoral studies in Anthropology at Stanford University, where he intends to study the relationship between foreign-funded engineering projects, globalization, and rising economic inequality in his parents’ home country of Afghanistan.
