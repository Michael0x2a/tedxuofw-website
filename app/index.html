        Like the universe, our capacity for discovery is limitless. And like stars
        in the sky, the ideas we produce are just a spark &ndash; flickers of 
        brilliance that weave together to create constellations of light. This 
        is what inspires us at TEDxUofW. At this year's conference, we hope to 
        explore the plexus of ideas, revelations, and observations that reveal 
        through our collective pursuit of critical thought and creative inquiry.
        We invite you to join us in discovering the possibilities hidden in our past,
        present, and future that can take the ordinary rhythm of our world and 
        <span class="glow">illuminate</span> what makes it extraordinary.
