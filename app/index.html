        Like the universe, our capacity for discovery is limitless. And like stars
        in the sky, the ideas we produce are just a spark &ndash; flickers of 
        brilliance that weave together to create constellations of light. This 
        is what inspires us at TEDxUofW. At this year's conference, we hope to 
        explore the plexus of ideas, revelations, and observations that reveal 
        through our collective pursuit of critical thought and creative inquiry.
        We invite you to join us in discovering the possibilities hidden in our past,
        present, and future that can take the ordinary rhythm of our world and 
        <span class="glow">illuminate</span> what makes it extraordinary.

          In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, <a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program">TEDx</a> is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)
