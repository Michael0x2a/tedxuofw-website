We independently plan and host a TEDx event every spring here at UW. What is TEDx? In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxUofW, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxUofW event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized."/><meta name="keywords" content="TEDxUofW, TEDx, TED, University of Washington, UW, TEDxUW, talks, TED talks, RSO"/><link rel="image_src" href="/assets/images/ted-logo-lightbulb-white-fb.png"/><link href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.0.3/css/font-awesome.css" rel="stylesheet"/><link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/styles-cd5a56cecc9dee399d5f42832d6874ac.css"><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico"/> <!--[if lt IE 9]><script src="https://oss.maxcdn.com/libs/html5shiv/3.7.0/html5shiv.js"></script><script src="https://oss.maxcdn.com/libs/respond.js/1.4.2/respond.min.js"></script><![endif]--></head><body role="document" class="hyphenate"> <!--[if lte IE 8]><div class="container old-ie"><h1>Uh oh!</h1><p>It looks like you're using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.

I've been a big fan of TED talks since high school, but it wasn't until a good friend (one of last year's curators) recruited me that I really became immersed in the TED brand. Despite my busy schedule, I knew I had to get involved again this year, and was thrilled when I became one of the curators. I love TED's mission of "ideas worth spreading" and the inspiration that stems from a variety of topics, from technology to human behavior to many other things. My favorite TED talk is called "The Power of Vulnerability", presented by Brene Brown. She discusses human connection and interaction, which I find fascinating and extremely relevant in my own life. This is what I think is so great about TED- the ability to inspire and motivate people to take what they've learned, and apply it to their own lives to transcend in the way that people think, feel and act."</p><h4>About</h4><p>Yifan works as a Peer Advisor in the UW Career Center, is a part of the business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi, and joined the student run consulting firm called Rho Consulting.

It was the very first TED talk I ever watched and it was definitely what got me hooked on TED in general! My experience with TEDxUofW so far has been nothing short of amazing. I was an Event Day Manager last year for the swag committee and had the time of my life working with my friends to plan for the event. I think what I love most about TEDxUofW is seeing such a diverse group of like-minded students come together to work towards a common goal - putting on the best TEDxUofW conference we can! TED represents innovation and a love and desire for learning, so it's inspiring to me to see so many students want to be apart of something bigger like that."</p><h4>About</h4><p>Emmeline is a business community Resident Advisor and campus tour guide at UW.

TED's tagline "Ideas Worth Spending" encapsulates the organization's novel capability of contributing to the development of human consciousness. My personal favorite TEDTalk is Dan Pallota's talk: "The Way We Think About Charity is Dead Wrong". Pallota asserts that in order to empower the non-profit world to have a more significant impact on global problems, we must shift the way we think about charities and the way they operate. I think this talk also fits in well with this year's TEDxUofW theme "Transcend with TED". I am extremely excited to help bring an awesome TEDx conference to UW this year!”</p><h4>About</h4><p>Sam currently interns at UBS for a Wealth Management Group and teaches a 24 student Freshman Business course on campus.
