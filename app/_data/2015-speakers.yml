    Born and raised in the Chicagoland (Glen Ellyn), Megan Roake is a second-year undergraduate at the University of Washington, double majoring in Law, Societies, and Justice, and Psychology, and is a triplet with two brothers. Megan is not afraid to confront the difficult, controversial, and “awkward” topic of sexual assault and relationship violence. In fact, she concentrates extensively on crisis, trauma, and recovery in regards to sexual assault and mental illness; she even plans to focus her academic degrees in these matters, where she intends to merge her personal experiences and professional interests. In response to her own rape, she partakes in and challenges informal and formal legal processes, prevention and advocacy organizations, and personal recovery. Her activism is grounded in her firm belief in the importance of challenging society’s ideas about consent and sexual assault itself as well as the extreme importance of creating strong and sustainable communities of survivors and allies. These ideas on trauma and healing were recently emphasized in her opinion piece featured in the University of Washington school newspaper: “To my supporters, I couldn’t do it without you” (UW Daily 02/27/2015).

    Nikkita Oliver is poet, teaching artists, community organizer, and activist working towards finishing a Juris Doctorate (June 2015) and a Masters of Education (March 2016). She has competed in multiple National Poetry Slam Competitions and just recently coached the Seattle Poetry Slam team to 7th of 72 teams at the 2015 National Poetry Slam in Oakland, CA. She has performed in venues in New York City, Seattle, Boston, Oakland, Olympia, WA and Everett, WA where she opened for Dr. Cornell West. Nikkita's idea worth spreading brings to light the power of art to make change! It has been said, "In any war the first thing you do is kill off the poets and the philosophers..." Why? Because these are the inspirers, the preservers of culture and record, the communal conscious, the deep thinkers and movement starters, the light barrers and whistleblowers, etc. Many artists are philosophers, many philosophers are poets and most poets are artists. When we investigate the history of social change movements we often find artists, poets and philosophers at the forefront. Art has the power to open hearts and minds in unsuspecting and powerful ways to create the necessary internal and external climate needed for individual and systemic social change.
